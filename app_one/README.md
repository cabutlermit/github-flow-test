# README for app_one

A single file in the app_one folder.

## 2nd test

This is the second test (now that we have fixed the prod-deploy.yml workflow).

All the releases and tags have been removed from the repository in GitHub. This will test a new feature branch for one application in the mono repo through the whole GH-flow process.

## 3rd test

This is the third test.

There is one existing release (v0.0.0) that worked properly and did not deploy anything. This will test whether a second release will properly deploy the application.
